# RAG-Multimodal Financial Document Analysis and Recall

This project demonstrates the use of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for analyzing financial data from multimodal PDF documents, such as quarterly reports. It combines the power of vector databases, language models, and vision-based AI to extract and retrieve insights from text, tables, and charts.

## Features

- **Automated Financial Analysis:** Extracts structured (tables) and unstructured (text) data from PDFs.
- **Multimodal Data Processing:** Analyzes visual elements like graphs and charts using AI.
- **Intelligent Query System:** A RAG-enabled chatbot provides accurate answers to complex financial queries.
- **Deep Memory Support:** Enhances retrieval accuracy by improving embedding quality for stored data.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Extracts text, tables, and visual data (charts/graphs) from PDFs.
   - Categorizes data into different types (text, table, graph) for efficient storage.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Adds metadata to extracted data for better organization and retrieval.
   - Processes charts and graphs using vision models to generate descriptive insights.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Stores processed data in a **Deep Lake vector database** with embeddings for similarity-based retrieval.

4. **Deep Memory Optimization (Optional):**
   - Trains the system to improve embedding quality using question-generation techniques.

5. **Chatbot Interaction:**
   - Users interact with a chatbot that retrieves and synthesizes data from the vector database to answer questions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI and Activeloop (Deep Lake)


## Example Use Case: Tesla Q3 2023 Report

This project demonstrates its capabilities using Tesla's Q3 2023 financial report as a sample.

### Extracted Data
- **Text:** Captures narrative insights such as financial highlights, company updates, and strategic goals.
- **Tables:** Extracts structured data like revenue, profit margins, and delivery statistics.
- **Graphs:** Processes visual elements like charts and diagrams to identify trends and summarize patterns.

### Chatbot Capabilities
The chatbot, powered by the RAG framework, can intelligently answer questions such as:
- **"What are the trends in vehicle deliveries?"**
  - Response: *The trends in vehicle deliveries for Q3 indicate a consistent upward trajectory.*
- **"What is the total revenue for the quarter?"**
  - Response: *The total revenue for Q3 was $23.4 billion, reflecting a 9% year-over-year increase.*

These responses are based on insights extracted from both textual data and visual elements like charts.

## Potential Applications

1. **Business Intelligence**
   - Automates the extraction and analysis of financial reports.
   - Enhances decision-making by delivering structured insights from unstructured documents.

2. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Provides quick and accurate access to critical financial data.
   - Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements by efficiently retrieving supporting information.

3. **Stakeholder Reporting**
   - Simplifies the process of generating reports for investors, executives, or regulatory bodies.
   - Streamlines access to key performance indicators and financial summaries.
