# Resume Keyword Highlighter

## Overview
In the fast-paced job market, the ability to stand out to potential employers is crucial. Our project, developed during the ARIES - IITD and Eightfold.ai Hackathon, introduces an automated solution aimed at enhancing the visibility of key skills and experiences on resumes. This tool is designed to assist both job candidates and recruiters by efficiently highlighting relevant parts of a resume based on specified focus areas.

## Problem Statement
The challenge addressed by our project is twofold. First, for job candidates, manually emphasizing the keywords and experiences that align with job descriptions is time-consuming and susceptible to oversight. Second, for recruiters, the task of sifting through numerous resumes to find specific details is equally daunting. Our solution automates the highlighting of words or phrases relevant to particular focus areas, such as "Enterprise SaaS Sales Experience" or "React Experience," thereby streamlining the evaluation process.

## Functionality
- The tool analyzes resumes and highlights terms related to the given focus area. For instance, if the focus is on "leadership qualities," it accentuates experiences like leading a team, showcasing the candidate's leadership skills.
- It supports both technical and soft skill queries, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of candidates.
- Highlights are applied directly to the resume for easy visualization, aiding recruiters in efficiently evaluating candidates.

## Evaluation Criteria
Our project was evaluated based on accuracy & relevance, strength of highlighting, latency, and robustness & noise handling. These factors ensure the solution's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its capability to accurately identify pertinent skills and handle various resume formats and irregularities.

## Input and Output
**Input**: Keywords or natural language queries related to the job focus area, along with the resume in PDF format.

**Output**: A resume with appropriately highlighted sections that correspond to the focus areas, facilitating a quick review process.

## Usage
This tool is invaluable for candidates aiming to enhance their resumes and for recruiters looking to streamline the candidate evaluation process. By simplifying the identification of key information, it enables both parties to focus on the fit between the candidate's qualifications and the job requirements.
