# AI and ML Projects Repository

Welcome to my AI-ML Projects repository! This is a collection of my personal projects and experiments in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The purpose of this repository is to showcase my work, document my learning journey, and provide a platform for collaboration with fellow enthusiasts and professionals.

## Overview

This repository contains a range of projects that demonstrate the application of various AI and ML techniques. From data analysis and visualization to predictive modeling and deep learning, these projects cover a breadth of topics within the AI/ML domain.

## Projects

Each project within this repository has its own dedicated folder containing:

- Jupyter notebooks with code, comments, and visualizations
- Relevant datasets used or generated during the project
- Any additional scripts or files required to run the project

## Technologies

The projects in this repository utilize a range of technologies and libraries, including but not limited to:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for these projects.
- **TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch**: For building and training neural network models.
- **scikit-learn**: For various machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Repository Structure


Each project folder contains a `README.md` file that explains the specific project in more detail, including the problem statement, data sources, methodology, and findings.
