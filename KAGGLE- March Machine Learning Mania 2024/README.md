# March Machine Learning Mania 2024 Competition

Welcome to the repository for my participation in the [March Machine Learning Mania 2024 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024) hosted on Kaggle.

## Overview
The March Machine Learning Mania competition invites participants to forecast the outcomes of the men's and women's 2024 collegiate basketball tournaments. Through the utilization of machine learning models and historical data analysis, participants aim to construct accurate brackets predicting tournament winners.

## Competition Description
Participants are tasked with predicting the results of the Division 1 Men's and Women's basketball tournaments by submitting a portfolio of brackets. Leveraging comprehensive historical data of NCAA games, competitors strive to craft predictive models that yield the most accurate bracket predictions.

## Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated based on the Average Brier Bracket Score. This metric assesses the performance of the submitted brackets against the actual outcomes, with lower Brier scores indicating more accurate predictions. The objective is to achieve the lowest possible Brier score to demonstrate superior predictive capability.
